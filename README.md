Code and data for the project on evolutionary discretization of gene expression profiles.

## GECCO 2022
The project led to a first publication in the GECCO conference: Mouhrim N. et al. "An Evolutionary Approach to the Discretization of Gene Expression Profiles to Predict the Severity of  COVID-19", 2022

The results for the paper were obtained using the code in src/EAprofileGenerator2Point.py

## EvoSTAR 2023
A second paper was published in the EvoApplications part of the EvoSTAR conference: Rojas-Velazquez D. et al. "Multi-Objective Evolutionary Discretization of Gene Expression Profiles: Application to COVID-19 Severity Prediction", 2023

The results for the paper were obtained using the code in src/MOEAprofileGenerator.py
